title: Ruby
---

Looking  at how other OS projects deal with community governance, I
was particularly struck by the apparent harmony of the Ruby language
community. So I wrote some pieces inviting others to consider their
model too. The first was received pretty well, receiving about a
dozen hearts quickly. But no replies - people are apparently
wary of speaking up here too. So to keep this record intact
despite possible future moderator suppression, and to make this
page self-contained, I'll reproduce that now:

I will add, as someone *with* experience in moderation, that ultra-specific policies tend to be more harmful than helpful, because people start looking for loopholes and ways to misbehave without *technically* violating the letter of the posted rules. This is sometimes called the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Not Touching You‚Äù phenomenon, after the meme of children doing things like ‚ÄúI touched his SLEEVE! You said I couldn‚Äôt touch HIM, but I touched his SLEEVE! I‚Äôm not touching HIM!‚Äù to try to keep fighting with each other after being told by adults to stop.

I agree with that. While I've advocated for "rule of law" systems, they're such a massive undertaking that, realistically, no OS project will ever adopt one. They're not only beyond the competences of tech nerds to create and administer, they're beyond their resources. Such things only grow ever more ponderous over time. They can certainly become soul-crushingly heavy too.

So scratch that. Poking around, there's a very different kind of approach. It appears that the Ruby community is well regarded for being welcoming and friendly to all in a highly international context. They don't have a "code of conduct" as such, and no pretensions to a "system of justice". Instead they list a few core principles. and _trust_ the community to play nice. The community in turn lives up to that trust. It's something I try to encourage by repeatedly emphasizing the Golden Rule and the principle of charity. That's all a healthy community really needs 99.9+% of the time, and to _stay_ healthy.

The heart of Ruby's philosophy is MINASWAN: "Matz is nice and so we are nice": Matz refers to  Yukihiro Matsumoto, Ruby's creator, who is indeed nice.

Here's "The Ruby Community Conduct Guideline":

https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/conduct/

- Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.

- Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.

- When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.

- Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.

That's it. No pretension to legalisms or comprehensiveness at all, and it doesn't bloat over time. It appears to "just work" for them.

Now Ruby on Rails is a different, although related, offshoot. Don't conflate the two. The RoR creator is a much more controversial figure, a "utility monster" if there ever was one. RoR has its own ideas.

And Ruby _conferences_ generally use some version of the Contributor Covenant instead. The concerns at in-person events are far more acute, where people are physically face-to-face in small spaces across some days. On the web, the worst we can do is throw pixels at each other across time zones :wink:. Conferences merit potentially much more heavy-handed, swift, and dictatorial power. Very different contexts, very different approaches.

In the Python world, Nicholas Tollervey is a beautiful, gentle soul who abandoned "PSF spaces" some years ago due to perceived hostility to, well, _being_ beautiful and gentle. He aimed at something roughly similar in spirit to the Ruby model, but even less prescriptive, via his "On Being Together" poem:

https://ntoll.org/article/on-being-together/

He went on to adopt the poem at the end as his "CARE_OF_COMMUNITY.rst" guideline for his own OS projects, licensed under CC0 1.0 for anyone to adopt:

https://github.com/ntoll/being_together?tab=readme-ov-file

So maybe those are better ways to frame the whole area. They certainly appeal to me. I don't want to tell people what to do. I want them to "be nice" by their own reflective informed choice, encouraged to do so by seeing a community that _is_ nice - to everyone. That can't be achieved by force.

The second post didn't fare so well. From my "Ban Q&A" page:

Q: Another hidden post?!

A: Yup. It is, after all, another day üòâ. This one is in topic "Suspension of Franz Kir√°ly", and the auto-generated system notification said it was flagged as "off topic" (a refreshing change from the usual "hateful", etc). Which it surely is, by a literal reading. But it's a bit of a challenge finding anything directly about the topic title anywhere in the 100+ posts already there. The actual discussion quickly diverged. Human discourse is discursive. This post was largely continuing a meditation on how the Ruby language community seems to manage to remain free of "conduct drama", and was inviting consideration of the underlying dynamics. I don't at all regret posting it. If it remains hidden, after a few days I'll reproduce it here.
