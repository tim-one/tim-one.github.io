After over a year of this  drama, I apparently became so annoying that the PSF finally revealed an actual bit of "evidence", which was portrayed as being a slam dunk [starting here](https://discuss.python.org/t/suspension-of-franz-kiraly/103776/95);

- Me" "You, for example, would not have signed off on publicly accusing me of “defending reverse sexism”, not just because you already know it’s something I _wouldn’t_ defend, but because I in fact never even mentioned the topic."

- Them: "There’s a now hidden post where you are doing exactly that."

I'm _delighted_ by that this is the first bit of _substantive_ repsonse I've seen to date. Bravo! Do more of that, please.

But, alas, it's more "god of the gaps" gaslighting, although I don't believe intentionally so.

It linked to a post that was, and remains, hidden. "Just trust us."

[Please read the post for yourself.](https://web.archive.org/web/20240718111426/https://discuss.python.org/t/im-leaving-too/58408)

That's a link to what the Internet Wayback Machine captured before the post was hidden. Neither I nor the PSF has any influence over it, and the archives there have been accepted as dispositive evidence in actual courts.

It's post #5 there, dated July 18, 2024, 3:24am.

If you're conteent to take my word for it instead, I'll post the content here. Apologies for that it looks like a 1-item bullet list.  Markdown doesn't appear to have a way to say "I just want some indented normally formatted text spanning paragraphs", but list items can be tricked into that:

   failing to acknowledge how and why they are using language that way sets up a situation where people talk past each other instead of productively

   True enough, but Karl didn't start this :wink:. As he quoted from the PSF CoC enforcement docs:

   > Reports that are not made in good faith (such as “reverse sexism” or “reverse racism”) may receive no response.

   They're so self-certain of knowing the One True Meaning that they preemptively dismiss anyone who dares to disagree as not acting "in good faith".

   I happen to agree that more useful definitions incorporate an analysis of power dynamics, but from the few CoC statements I've seen on mailing lists in response, they _mean_ "by definition, only whites can be racist". Which is a popular view among "US white left-of-center liberals", but is especially problematic for a global organization to embrace as Absolute Truth.

   I'm not going to argue about it, though. It's just a good thing Karl is leaving, before he gets pecked to death :frowning_face:.

End of attempt at transcription.

My glosses:

- As I said, it didn't address "reverse sexism" directly at all. The phrase appoears only as part of a verbatim quote from a post I was replying to.

- No, "only whites can be racist" is not an attempt at sarcasm or humor. That _is_ the high-order bit of what the PSF means by the term. And also mostly what I mean by it.

- But it's not a universally accepted meaning, and is not the only view that can be expressed in "good faith", despite the PSF's dogmatic insistence that it is.

- In a later post, sensing that this post was somehow widely misread, I expanded a bit to "all races can be prejudiced, but only whites can be racist", and linked to a "100% woke" academic source that spelled out what the PSF (and mostly me too) means. And explicitly endorsed that source. That post is still visible (but already linked to elsewhere in this blog).

- The intended meaning arose in academia, and is indeed rooted in "analysis of power dynamics", which I explicitly said above I agreed with. It's in _opposition_ to Karl's view. But even then, it still didn't mention "reverse sexism", but instead alluded to the related (in academia) "reverse racism".

- The meaning also gained traction among, especially, US college students, and social justice activists. But, no, most people in the Python world don't attend "social justice in tech" conferences. Some do. The PSF seems to _assume_ it's univerally accepted. It isn't, and I was defending Karl _expressing_ his own take, despite that it wasn't in agreement with the PSF's (or mine).

- I suspect that what some flaggers were _actually_ offended by was the phrase "US white left-of-center liberals". That was some admittedly too-obscure "Uncle Timmy snarky humor". The "joke" was that, while I don't endorse any political party in general, I've _mostly_ been a "US white left-of-center liberal" myself over the decades. It was poking some fun at who I've most often viewed as being "my people", and so also, by extension, at myself. I tried to clarify that too in a later post.

I can certainly understand how a _careless_ reading could come away with an impression the opposite of what it actually said, and especially if read by someone already inclined to resent me ("confirmation bias") and/or Karl ("guilt by association"). But that's why a, at harshest, "reasonable peroon" standard is vital. Else anyone can be crushed for anything they post.

I cannot undestand why an enforecment group never asked the accused for a response to any of the charges, or even disclosed their existence, until after highly public accusations were already posted, and the accused was already banned. It's not like this was treated with urgency. The predulce dragged on for months. The Golden Rule is spinning in its grave.
