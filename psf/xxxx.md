title: Jane, you ignorant XXXX
---

Trigger warning: if you found this page, you almost certainly know what XXXX meant in context
already. Don't come whining to me if you read on anyway - you're actively looking for offense then.

This relates to one of my [crimes]():

- Using potentially offensive language or slurs, in one case even calling an SNL skit from
the 1970s using the same slur “genuinely funny”, which shows a lack of empathy towards
other community members.

The Ministry of Truth apparently put the original post into the memory hole. But they left a copy
of the relevant part quoted in a 
[later post](https://discuss.python.org/t/for-your-consideration-proposed-bylaws-changes-to-improve-our-membership-experience/55696/150):

Of course Dan's line was "Jane, you ignorant slut!". The name of the Python package was `slut.py`.

Note that I never said the skit was funny. I said the _show_ was funny, to help date it.
Even then, the "wink" was a telegraphic clue about a larger digression that wasn't worth
typing out: the meaning of "generally funny" is subjective. But it's a fact that the
Akroyd/Curtin days are widely viewed as being SNL's "Golden Years".

Neither did I say, or imply, that SNL was funny _because_ it used the word "slut".

And I said it was an American show as a clue to many international readers (especially European) that
they'd probably find it as inoffensive as applesauce. In many other cultures, "slut" has no "shock value"
at all - they routinely hear far harsher on their mainstream TV channels.

SNL was in fact irrelevant to the point. It was merely a way to let people know which word I had in 
mind, without actually using the word, which word I know makes some people uncomfortable. So, ya, more
of my crimes involve convolutions to _avoid_ giving offense. I may have mentioned before that
it's impossible to "win" this stupid game :wink:.

And why was it important that people know the word in question? Because I want to be explicit when
I'm talking: plain and clear. I'm not a bureaucrat or a politician. "Explicit is better than implicit."

In context we were talking about how high a bar the Board should have to leap to vote out a Fellow. I
was arguing for a unanimous vote, which the Board almost always achieved in my years on it. But, while
people in general can't think their way out of a sheet of wet tissue paper without knee-jerk
confirmation bias "thinking" for them, here I was presenting evidence _contrary_ to my position. Why?
Because I want to be fair.

This was one of the very earliest CoC enforcement actions, and I was on the Board at the time,
and the vote was as close as possible to being tied. It was evidence of that _maybe_ "unanimous"
was too high a bar for a major CoC decision. In the `slut.py` case, the issue was about as
minor as possible (nobody actually cared about the package - not even its author replied to
questions about it).

As to SNL: yes, while I never said so, I did think the recurring Akroyd/Curtin "Point, Counterpoint"
segments were comedy gold. Brilliant comic writing, brilliantly delivered by Curtin and Akroyd.
Akroyd's "Jane, you ignorant slut!" catchphrase was a tiny part of it, no more or less funny than
Curtin's "Dan, you pompous ass!" and "Dan, you miserable failure!" catchphrases.

It was hilarious parody of the "60 Minutes" recurring "Point, Counterpoint" segments. It was also
a major accomplishment for comediennes: Curtin's recurring role in this segment ensured her
steady work in an extremely competitive environment, playing an intelligent character. Not a
bimbo, airhead, scold, or passive victim. Major props to her and Akroyd.
