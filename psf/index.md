## Dysfunction

“So the pendulum swings, now violently, now slowly; and every institution not only carries within it the seeds of its own dissolution, but prepares the way for its most hated rival.” —  William Ralph Inge

- [**"willy Wokesson"'s**](censored) 2024 disturbingly suppressed call for discussion on the PSF's Discourse
> t's crucial to differentiate between truly harmful behavior and discussions that might challenge our sensibilities but contribute to our collective growth.
- [**Peter Bittner's**](https://painless.software/letter-to-tim-peters-author-of-pep20) 2024 "Letter to Tim Peters, Author of PEP20"
>  My vision of a society that I want to live in is one where people try to understand each other, even when this is difficult sometimes. 
- [**Steve Holden's**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/holdenweb_psf-coc-banishment-activity-7248238831806595072-sPbY) 2024 LinkedIn post on proper balance among Foundation goals
> I’d suggest that the latter goal is being incorrectly emphasised over the former, by people with little to no experience of managing anything **except** software foundations, who are out of their depth in the storm they’ve created.
- [**Nicholas Tollervey's**](https://ntoll.org/article/psf-woe) 2024 plea for compassion and honesty to counter PSF dysfunction
> There appears to be confusion between things that should be celebrated (like passion, humour, honesty, differences of culture and diversity of experience) and things that are genuinely problematic (like deliberate bad-faith activity or intentionally diminishing, dehumanizing, harming or harassing others).
- [**David Mertz's**](https://gnosis.cx/publish/ED-CoC-complaint) 2024 complaint to the PSF Board and CoC WG about unprofessional behavior by the Executive Director of the Foundation
> The PSF Executive Director, Deb Nicholson, has behaved in a manner that is unprofessional, motivated by personal animosity, in violation of Foundation bylaws, and that violated her fiduciary obligations as an employee and officer of the Foundation.
- - [**David Mertz**](https://gnosis.cx/publish/Board-of-Fools) publishes the Board's reply, which passed a motion giving the Executive Director new powers, but claims that these new powers also apply retroactively
>> It’s like a clown car ... I actually don’t think this is a deliberate power grab by the Executive Director. Rather, I think she is as oblivious to US law as are the current Board.
- [**ExternalUserError's**](https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ftbjt8/ban_transparency_from_tim_peters/lpsp3xa/) 2024 insightful Reddit comment on CoC enforcement dysfunctions in general
>  It's like you take everything we know to work about a working justice system and do the complete opposite.
> There's really just no way this system could ever produce good results, no matter who is in charge.
- [**David Mertz's**](https://gnosis.cx/publish/Emeritus) 2024 emeritus request letter explained his reasons for withdrawing his active Fellow status
> I simply believe that that honor that was formerly attached to becoming a Fellow of the Foundation has been stripped of good will or honor by those intent on exercise of arbitrary self-aggrandizement and grandstanding.
- [**African Python groups'**](https://pythonafrica.blogspot.com/2023/12/an-open-letter-to-python-software_5.html) 2023 open letter about multiple problems working with the PSF
> More recent experiences have left us feeling hurt and angry. We hear voices, openly and confidently raised within the PSF, that denigrate us and our communities, that dismiss our experiences, that doubt our values, and harm us materially.
