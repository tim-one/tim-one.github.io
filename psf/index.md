## 2024 bans

- [**Tim's**](silly) non-rebuttal of the list of his "crimes" in his ban
- [**Chris McDonough's**](https://chrismcdonough.substack.com/p/ban-transparency-from-tim-peters) account of Tim's account of pre-ban PSF interactions
- [**Tim's**](ban) account of PSF interactions before his ban
  - and [**brief Q&A**](ban_qa) from responses to Tim's account
- [**LWN's**](https://lwn.net/Articles/988894/) account of Tim's ban; by far the best "news" article I've seen, finding fault on all sides
- [**Chris McDonough's**](https://chrismcdonough.substack.com/p/the-shameful-defenestration-of-tim) account of Tim's ban announcement
- [**Karl Knechtel's**](https://zahlman.github.io/politics/the-psf/2024/08/10/open-letter-psf-coc-wg-addendum-1-tim-peters.html) account of Tim's ban announcement
- [**Karl Knechtel's**](https://zahlman.github.io/politics/the-psf/2024/07/31/an-open-letter-to-the-psf-coc-wg.html) account of his and David Mertz's indefinite suspensions from Discourse, and anticipating Tim's later ban (Karl may be neurodivergent, but he's not dense ;-))

## Dysfunction

- [**Peter Bittner's**](https://painless.software/letter-to-tim-peters-author-of-pep20) "Letter to Tim Peters, Author of PEP20"
>  My vision of a society that I want to live in is one where people try to understand each other, even when this is difficult sometimes. 
- [**Steve Holden's**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/holdenweb_psf-coc-banishment-activity-7248238831806595072-sPbY) 2024 LinkedIn post on proper balance among Foundation goals
> I’d suggest that the latter goal is being incorrectly emphasised over the former, by people with little to no experience of managing anything **except** software foundations, who are out of their depth in the storm they’ve created.
- [**Nicholas Tollervey's**](https://ntoll.org/article/psf-woe) 2024 plea for compassion and honesty to counter PSF dysfunction
> There appears to be confusion between things that should be celebrated (like passion, humour, honesty, differences of culture and diversity of experience) and things that are genuinely problematic (like deliberate bad-faith activity or intentionally diminishing, dehumanizing, harming or harassing others).
- [**David Mertz's**](https://gnosis.cx/publish/ED-CoC-complaint) Complaint to the PSF Board and CoC WG about unprofessional behavior by the Executive Director of the Foundation
> The PSF Executive Director, Deb Nicholson, has behaved in a manner that is unprofessional, motivated by personal animosity, in violation of Foundation bylaws, and that violated her fiduciary obligations as an employee and officer of the Foundation.
- - [**David Mertz**](https://gnosis.cx/publish/Board-of-Fools) publishes the Board's reply, which passed a motion giving the Executive Director new powers, but claims that these new powers also apply retroactively
>> I have to say that while I might have been a bit peeved at the people involved before, now I’m ONLY disappointed. It’s like a clown car, and I have genuine pity for my friends and colleagues who are still riding inside of it.
- [**David Mertz's**](https://gnosis.cx/publish/Emeritus) 2024 emeritus request letter explained his reasons for withdrawing his active Fellow status
> I simply believe that that honor that was formerly attached to becoming a Fellow of the Foundation has been stripped of good will or honor by those intent on exercise of arbitrary self-aggrandizement and grandstanding.
- [**African Python groups'**](https://pythonafrica.blogspot.com/2023/12/an-open-letter-to-python-software_5.html) 2023 open letter about multiple problems working with the PSF
> More recent experiences have left us feeling hurt and angry. We hear voices, openly and confidently raised within the PSF, that denigrate us and our communities, that dismiss our experiences, that doubt our values, and harm us materially.
