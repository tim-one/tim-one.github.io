title: The crimes

For reference, the bizarre list of "CoC violations", supplied by the CoC WG, parroted in my [ban announcement](https://discuss.python.org/t/three-month-suspension-for-a-core-developer/60250):

- Overloading the discussion of the bylaws change (47 out of 177 posts in topic at the time the moderators closed the topic), which created an atmosphere of fear, uncertainty, and doubt, which encouraged increasingly emotional responses from other community members. The later result of the vote showed 81% support for the most controversial of the bylaws changes, which demonstrates the controversy was blown out of proportion. [&#x27F6;](https://discuss.python.org/t/shedding-light-on-a-three-month-suspension/66337/79)

- Defending “reverse racism” and “reverse sexism”, concepts not backed by empirical evidence, which could be seen as deliberate intimidation or creating an exclusionary environment. [&#x27F6;](silly)

- Using potentially offensive language or slurs, in one case even calling an SNL skit from the 1970s using the same slur “genuinely funny”, which shows a lack of empathy towards other community members. [&#x27F6;](ban_qa#crimeSNL)

- Making light of sensitive topics like workplace sexual harassment, which could be interpreted as harassment or creating an unwelcoming environment.

- Casually mentioning scenarios involving sexual abuse, which may be inappropriate or triggering for some audiences.

- Discussing bans or removals of community members, which may be seen as publishing private information without permission. [&#x27F6;](ban_qa#crimeAnon)

- Dismissing unacceptable behavior of others as a “neurodivergent” trait, which is problematic because it creates a stereotype that neurodivergent people are hard to interact with and need special treatment.

- Excessive discussion of controversial topics or past conflicts, which could be seen as sustained disruption of community discussions.

- Use of potentially offensive terms, even when self-censored or alluded to indirectly.

- Making assumptions or speculations about other community members’ motivations and/or mental health.
