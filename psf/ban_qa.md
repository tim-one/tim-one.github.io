Brief replies to questions from a variety of sources, most recent first.

**Q:** So how many topics _did_ you start?

**A:** Across the time in question, one. It was originally titled "Are the neurodivergent welcome here?". In a long, thoughtful, and helpful reply, Glyph said it would help to reframe it a bit. I replied, in part:
> I’m not up to rewriting the whole OP, but if someone can think up a better title I’d be delighted to change it. Wholly agreed that the title now is so overly broad as to be largely devoid of coherent meaning.

Glyph replied, in part:
>  I think that leaving the OP as-is is fine, sometimes a discussion ends in a different place where it begins.
>
> As for a title, “How can we better support neurodivergent newcomers to the community?” might reflect my proposed pivot.

Which I gratefully accepted, and changed the title accordingly.

Discourse also says "Considerations around legal advice" is my topic, but I didn't start it, or name it. As already detailed in my [Dispelling Information Asymmetry](ban) post, a moderator split it off from a reply of mine in the bylaws topic. They gave it the title too, and, as I already said there, what they did was fine by me.

**Q:** Why did you endlessly relitigate the bylaws vote?

**A:** I have no idea what they're talking about. I stopped mentioning it well before the vote started. My last two posts _in_ the topic were entirely position-neutral, just reminding people that the deadline for affirming their intention to vote was imminent (something PSF staff was apparently too busy to remind people of themselves). I never mentioned the vote again. Next time I saw anything about it was at the top of my list of ["offenses"](crimes).

**Q:** Why do you endlessly oppose the CoC?

**A:** I don't. I voted for the initial CoC when I was on the Board. And when I talked about Python's early days, that was an opportunity for people to learn some entertaining and educational (if I say so myself) history. If people let confirmation bias, bad faith, or ill will blind them to that, that's their loss. [Here](https://discuss.python.org/t/inclusive-communications-expectations-in-python-spaces/57950/15):
>> [Ned Batchelder] I’m fully in favor of the community educating or excluding someone who is “routinely impatient and dismissive.” Allowing that behavior drives other people out. It’s a bad tradeoff.

> [me] I actually agree. In the early days, Python was in much more of a “beggars can’t be choosers” category. It outgrew that long ago.

Nothing is really new. Much the same [here](https://discuss.python.org/t/discussion-about-recent-coc-events/5778/23) from 4 years ago:
> [me] Usenet is one end of the spectrum; living in a North Korean re-education camp is the other, and I don’t want that either

In my view the PSF has been moving steadily toward the latter.

**Q:** Is Ethan Furman a friend of yours covering for you?

**A:** No. His dissent was a surprise to me. I recognized his name, as I recognize at least hundreds of Pythoneers' names. We didn't correspond before he posted his dissent, and, in fact, over a month passed before I remembered _why_ I recognized his name.

I was the only active admin on the python-dev mailing list for many years. I volunteered to step down if someone would step up (to take over the thankless job) who was willing to be more active (than I was willing to be) in moderating. Ethan volunteered. I didn't select him - I explicitly wanted no say in who took over. I believe the SC (at the time) gave him the job.

I do count him as a friend now. As to whether he was covering for me, I think his brief dissent speaks for itself: to his moderator's eyes, "I found that Core Developer’s behavior to be exemplary". I wouldn't go that far, but I don't believe I materially violated the CoC under a "reasonable person" standard.

**Q:** Why did you say you never intended to post again in the neurodivergence topic?

**A:** In fact, while I never said a word about this, I stopped posting in the PSF category entirely, and intended never to post anywhere under PSF again. Suffice it to say that I thought the neurodivergence topic was important, but that if I posted in it again the topic would, e.g. be closed just to spite me. I wanted to head that off.

Alas, the topic eventually got closed anyway, despite that it remained civil throughout, and didn't reach a "natural" conclusion. It had built up a lot of good energy, but got stalled when nobody stepped up to "do something".

Addressing questions in replies to [Ethan's followup post](https://discuss.python.org/t/shedding-light-on-a-three-month-suspension/66337):

- As of Aug 8, the day after the ban was announced, the SC represented to me that I had already agreed to do everything they asked for the ban to be lifted on the expiration day. It's not lifting of the ban I'm aiming at, it's transparency.

- However, Aug 8 is also the last time I heard from the SC. They haven't replied to anything I sent to them since. I'm apparently ghosted for the duration.

- Which is why I didn't ask for permission. I don't get a reply to anything anymore, and I will not publish their email without their explicit permission.

- But all of that happened after the ban, so was out of scope for my pre-ban blog.

- I still intend to return. I can't say whether the SC has changed their collective mind.
