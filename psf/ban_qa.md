Brief replies to questions from a variety of sources, most recent first.

**Q:** Would it help if I resigned as a core dev? Relinquish Fellow status?

**A:** Do what's best for you, but I hope you don't. There's no reason to expect "they" would care, and your best hope for change is to keep your ability to vote on possible changes to governance PEPs, and maybe even bylaw changes.

**Q:** What's up with the "bullying" claims? Isn't that extreme?

**A:** Dictionary definition. People with power abusing it to harm someone with none. Stalin-era show trials were more transparent and fair-minded. So if you think those were bullying (they were - hugely so), well, this was worse in some respects[^stalin]. For example, Stalin's "courts" at least pretended to present evidence, not just spray raw assertions. And they let the accused speak. I wasn't even informed there _was_ a secret trial before it was over, and I was already banished and silenced. It didn't even meet the level of basic human decency.

Not just to me. I've long objected to the seemingly calculated cruelty of the PSF banning processes. I recognize that few others seem to care. Well, shame on those who don't. Going along with a self-righteous mob is rarely something to be proud of, and history generally doesn't look kindly on a Nuremberg defense.

[^stalin]: But, of course, incomparably better in others; e.g., I wasn't imprisoned, or executed. For which I'm grateful :wink:.

**Q:** For someone who claims not to be Guido's oracle anymore, why are you acting as one?

**A:** Heh. Fair point :-) I thought my last Q&A said so little he wouldn't mind, but not long after publishing I asked him if he was comfortable with the words I (didn't) put into his mouth. He replied "Yeah, that's about right ..."), so we're cool.

I felt I had to say something, because that's the single most frequent question I get, and I try to do the best I can to address all sincere questions. Stonewalling isn't my style - people are sick to death of that.

**Q:** What does Guido think about all this?

**A:** While I spent years being his oracle, that's no longer my role. If he wants to be clear he'll need to speak for himself. Of course I know more, but in good conscience can only confirm the obvious: he hasn't said one public word in support of, or opposing, anyone's position in this.

Which actually speaks volumes, but it's easy to misread what silence is saying. The most obvious reading is that he has no opinion. Since that's not credible here, the second-most obvious is that he wants no public part of it. That's closer.

Please don't bug him about it. Some people find human drama very stressful, and I don't think it's a secret where Guido lies on that axis. The drama in the "walrus operator" flame wars 6 years ago caused him to abdicate his BDFL role. I got my (much smaller) share of abuse in that too, but shrugged it off as "another day on a mailing list", day by day.

At this point, I don't think it matters anymore what anyone says anyway. Confirmation bias alone ensures all sides will remain frozen.

**Q:** Se Ethan wasn't your friend - what about Chris McDonough?

**A:** Chris surprised me too! Chris was an old "work friend", back from when Zope Corp hired PythonLabs (2000). Due to odd working conditions (cities about 60 miles apart, usually working remotely, and carpooling when Guido, Fred Drake, and I did go to headquarters), I almost never saw my Zope coworkers socially outside of work. Relations were friendly among all, and Chris and I hit it off well, but no "real friendships" could grow on such arid land. When I left Zope Corp, we all fell mostly out of touch at once.

So it took me by surprise when Chris emailed to say he had written a blog post, and asked me to review it. I was astonished at the clarity of thought and expression - I had no idea how talented an observer, thinker, and writer Chris was. I had some disagreements, but too minor to push. The influence of my review was limited to minor changes in the sections about Python's early days. For the rest, Chris speaks for Chris, and his voice is authentic. Preserving that authenticity was far more important to my eyes to risk losing it to "written by committee" quibbles over, e.g., guesses about what some of the charges against me were "really" about.

I loved the post mostly for its love letters to Python and its community. Which, like it or not, I did play foundational roles in creating. As I've mentioned elsewhere in my blog, the list of charges is so contrived they're not worth the bother of "refuting". Chris's analysis of those was the least interesting part to me, but Chris put real effort into that too, and he deserved better than to have it offhandedly dismissed as "analysis". He put approximately infinitely more effort into analyzing the evidence than the ban announcement put into presenting a coherent case.

**Q:** You said you filed a CoC complaint of your own before the ban. How was that resolved?

**A:** Don't know. After 4 days, I got a 1-line reply: "Tim, we acknowledge receipt of your report." After 7 weeks of silence passed, I politely asked for a response. That was about 3 weeks ago. Still no response.

I see that a target of the complaint no longer has the position they had at the time of the complaint. But, technically, they have even more power now. Perhaps more removed from interacting with those without power. I would have happily settled for a private apology to me (and to the others involved - I can't know how many others received private messages spreading egregiously bad-faith libels about me on Discourse).

**2024-10-14 Mon 09:30p CDT**

**Q:** Who likes old comedy shows?! And where's the post? I can't find it.<br>
**Q:** The ban announcement says you made 47 posts in the bylaws topic. But Discourse only shows 46. What's up?

**A:** Same answer to both. [Click here.](xxxx)

**2024-10-12 Sat 8:15p CDT**

**Q:** You won't publish your emails with the SC without permission, but which specific message did they give as an example?

**A:** I can't be sure, because they didn't supply a link. It had _something_ to do with sexual harassment, and all guesses I've seen match mine, that they must be referring to [this message](https://discuss.python.org/t/for-your-consideration-proposed-bylaws-changes-to-improve-our-membership-experience/55696/75), which briefly mentioned the topic. I have yet to see anyone, anywhere say that they did - or even _could_ - read it as making light of anything related to the topic. It's easy to find people who read it as intended (as condemnation of injustice to the _victims_): in replies to the SC's own topic, in various blogs, and in any number of "tech gossip" sites' comment sections. So while someone may very well have taken unintended offense at it, and I regret that if so, it cannot pass a "reasonable person" test.

BTW, that post got hidden "by community flags" at the time. I couldn't guess why, and ignored the hiding. The mods soon enough resurrected the post on their own initiative, so it apparently didn't violate the CoC to their eyes either. My best _guess_ was that it got hidden by American political partisans annoyed at my unflattering characterization of many US national politicians (regardless of party): elites who get free passes on many kinds of toxic behaviors solely because of their status.

**Q:** Don't you take responsibility for _anything_?

**A:** Sure! But not at all for being some kind of monster. I'm not. [See here](meaculpa) for my view of what went wrong.

**2024-10-09 Wed 7:00p CDT**

**Q:** So how many topics _did_ you start?

**A:** Across the time in question, one. It was originally titled "Are the neurodivergent welcome here?". In a long, thoughtful, and helpful reply, Glyph said it would help to reframe it a bit. I replied, in part:
> I’m not up to rewriting the whole OP, but if someone can think up a better title I’d be delighted to change it. Wholly agreed that the title now is so overly broad as to be largely devoid of coherent meaning.

Glyph replied, in part:
>  I think that leaving the OP as-is is fine, sometimes a discussion ends in a different place where it begins.
>
> As for a title, “How can we better support neurodivergent newcomers to the community?” might reflect my proposed pivot.

Which I gratefully accepted, and changed the title accordingly.

Discourse also says "Considerations around legal advice" is my topic, but I didn't start it, or name it. As already detailed in my [Dispelling Information Asymmetry](ban) post, a moderator split it off from a reply of mine in the bylaws topic. They gave it the title too, and, as I already said there, what they did was fine by me.

**Q:** Why did you endlessly relitigate the bylaws vote?

**A:** I have no idea what they're talking about. I stopped mentioning it well before the vote started. My last two posts _in_ the topic were entirely position-neutral, just reminding people that the deadline for affirming their intention to vote was imminent (something PSF staff was apparently too busy to remind people of themselves). I never mentioned the vote again. Next time I saw anything about it was at the top of my list of ["offenses"](crimes).

**Q:** Why do you endlessly oppose the CoC?

**A:** I don't. I voted for the initial CoC when I was on the Board. And when I talked about Python's early days, that was an opportunity for people to learn some entertaining and educational (if I say so myself) history. If people let confirmation bias, bad faith, or ill will blind them to that, that's their loss. [Here](https://discuss.python.org/t/inclusive-communications-expectations-in-python-spaces/57950/15):
>> [Ned Batchelder] I’m fully in favor of the community educating or excluding someone who is “routinely impatient and dismissive.” Allowing that behavior drives other people out. It’s a bad tradeoff.

> [me] I actually agree. In the early days, Python was in much more of a “beggars can’t be choosers” category. It outgrew that long ago.

Nothing is really new. Much the same [here](https://discuss.python.org/t/discussion-about-recent-coc-events/5778/23) from 4 years ago:
> [me] Usenet is one end of the spectrum; living in a North Korean re-education camp is the other, and I don’t want that either

In my view the PSF has been moving steadily toward the latter.

**Q:** Is Ethan Furman a friend of yours covering for you?

**A:** No. His dissent was a surprise to me. I recognized his name, as I recognize at least hundreds of Pythoneers' names. We didn't correspond before he posted his dissent, and, in fact, over a month passed before I remembered _why_ I recognized his name.

I was the only active admin on the python-dev mailing list for many years. I volunteered to step down if someone would step up (to take over the thankless job) who was willing to be more active (than I was willing to be) in moderating. Ethan volunteered. I didn't select him - I explicitly wanted no say in who took over. I believe the SC (at the time) gave him the job.

I do count him as a friend now. As to whether he was covering for me, I think his brief dissent speaks for itself: to his moderator's eyes, "I found that Core Developer’s behavior to be exemplary". I wouldn't go that far, but I don't believe I materially violated the CoC under a "reasonable person" standard.

**Q:** Why did you say you never intended to post again in the neurodivergence topic?

**A:** In fact, while I never said a word about this, I stopped posting in the PSF category entirely, and intended never to post anywhere under PSF again. Suffice it to say that I thought the neurodivergence topic was important, but that if I posted in it again the topic would, e.g. be closed just to spite me. I wanted to head that off.

Alas, the topic eventually got closed anyway, despite that it remained civil throughout, and didn't reach a "natural" conclusion. It had built up a lot of good energy, but got stalled when nobody stepped up to "do something". 

**2024-10-02 Wed 10:00p CDT**

Addressing questions in replies to [Ethan's followup post](https://discuss.python.org/t/shedding-light-on-a-three-month-suspension/66337):

- As of Aug 8, the day after the ban was announced, the SC represented to me that I had already agreed to do everything they asked for the ban to be lifted on the expiration day. It's not lifting of the ban I'm aiming at, it's transparency.

- However, Aug 8 is also the last time I heard from the SC. They haven't replied to anything I sent to them since. I'm apparently ghosted for the duration.

- Which is why I didn't ask for permission. I don't get a reply to anything anymore, and I will not publish their email without their explicit permission.

- But all of that happened after the ban, so was out of scope for my pre-ban blog.

- I still intend to return. I can't say whether the SC has changed their collective mind.
