title: Drift
---

Drift, or creep, happens to governance systems over time. Their original goals can even got lost, or actively opposed, over time. This is
especially so in systems insulated from feedback from the governed. Then internal echo chambers intensify the process, with internal players
seeming, at times, to egg each other on in a race to the bottom.

Drift is incremental, and not always monotonic. And sometimes it's "secret", not visible to the public.

Following are some examples. It will probably grow over time.

#### Early but telling drift

One of the first visible actions in the "brave new CoC" era was blocking an unpopular person on GitHub. They posted
mildly annoying outlines filled with links to pages they presumably found interesting. They never bothered anyone beyond this.
But rather than serve the original stated goal of fostering a welcoming community, the CoC was employed as a bludgeon to
drive someone out. And a person who was quite possibly of a class more recent CoCs recognize as worthy of protection
(neurodivergent - posting lists of links appeared to be their only communication style, in or out of "PSF spaces").

```

#### Mission creep

The PSF's [code of conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/) is very legalistic in tone,
with a relatively massive section on "Scope". It, e.g., takes pains to point out that even hallways in conference
venues are subject to CoC enforcement. Well, duh :wink:. But it seems to be very explicit overall that only official
"PSF spaces" and only spokespeople acting on behalf of the PSF are covered.

And [a good piece](https://snarky.ca/what-the-psf-conduct-wg-does/) from a long-time CoC WG member seems to acknowledge this:

> What you do in your life outside of Python is none of the WG's concern,

But that's not really a recognized constraint:

> but if you, e,g., call out your PSF affiliation on your profile on X and then post something that goes against
> the CoC, then that's a problem as that then reflects poorly on the PSF and the rest of the membership.

I see nothing in the actual CoC than can be read that way. Can you? I'm not a lawyer. I don't recall whether
I ever said on my blog whether or not I'm a PSF member, but it's not a secret that I am (I'm a long-time Fellow,
in fact). Does saying that out loud now make my blog subject to PSF censorship? We'll see.

And it may not end even there:

> Now, if someone were to very publicly come out as a member of some heinous organization even without talking about
> Python then that might be enough to warrant the Conduct WG saying something to the PSF board (and this probably
> applies more to Fellows than general members), but I haven't seen that happen.

Like bureaucracies everywhere, they don't actually recognize limits on the power they "should" have to control.

#### Drift to indulge personal pecadillos

This can also be seen as how well-intended overreach can backfire, causing more pain than it could spare.

I've mentioned briefly on d.p.o. that a woman contacted me (in December of 2024) to relate her tale of d.p.o.
moderation pain. I say "a woman" because that was a demographic marker for people the CoC especially intended
to make welcome. Otherwise I wouldn't care.

She doesn't post broadly, but appears to be highly respected for careful, informed posts (she has a doctorate
in her field, and obviously puts real thought into her posts).

I have her permission to use her name (she's brave!), and screenshots of all the mod interactions she had, 
but I don't think those necessary to make the point. I don't care about "assigning blame". I care about
toxic _processes_.

She posted a message containing

> I can't make sense of "keep it mostly the same but harm user experience".

Looks ordinary to me. But a mod insisted that the word "harm" was "unnecessarily negative", and wouldn't budge.
Seems at the very worst a micro-aggression, but I can't stretch it even that far. It's common wording in the computer
world to invoke an image of harm. Start with Dijkstra's famous "Go To Statement Considered Harmful".
What - well - harm did the mod imagine her word might cause?

It certainly caused her pain to be read in the worst possible imaginable light. She felt the opposite
of "welcome". In her words:

> More importantly though, I think that by intentionally reading the worst possible intent, one that requires adding

Indeed, the people who leave remain invisible forever more.

And the final insult: her "trust level" on Discourse was reduced from level 3 to level 2 as a result. What kind
of petty torment is that?! Going on a year now, I see it's still at level 2. BTW, she did reword the post.
