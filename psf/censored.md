This was posted in the early morning of 2024-11-08 to the PSF category. It was hidden "by community flags" very quickly, and not long after was purged entirely (there's no trace of it left).

It was from a new account, almost certainly using a pseudonym. Here's the [account info](https://discuss.python.org/u/woke/summary), which says:

"""<br>
willy Wokesson<br>
woke<br>
This user is suspended.<br>
Reason: No constructive purpose to their actions other than creating dissent within the community<br>
"""

I see no legitimate reason for these actions. To the contrary, a healthy community _needs_ open discussion of contentious issues!

My personal complaint is that "willy" mispresented what I did, but by echoing the misrepresntatinos the PSF made in my list of ["violationd"](crimes) (no, I never mentioned reverse sexism; no, far from defending the doctrine of reverse racism, I opposed it; and I never expressed an opinion about any SNL sketch - all misreading the plain meaning of plain English).


Subject: [PSF] A Call for Balance: Reconsidering extremist political views<br>
Date: 2024-11-08 Fri

Dear Python Community,

[Referenced post](https://discuss.python.org/t/three-month-suspension-for-a-core-developer/60250)

Recently, a decision was made by the Steering Council, following a recommendation from the PSF's Code of Conduct Workgroup, to suspend a core developer for what seems to be their divergence from an overly stringent interpretation of our community guidelines. This case raises significant concerns about the direction in which our community is heading, particularly at a time when there's a noticeable pushback against excessive political correctness in broader society.

Here are several points for consideration:

1. Misalignment with Community Sentiment:

  * The recent political climate in the U.S., where the majority voted for pushback on extremist "woke" views by rejecting the democrats and electing Trump by popular vote, indicates a broader societal fatigue with what many perceive as extreme wokeness. While our community isn't a political entity, we must not alienate contributors by enforcing views that are not universally accepted or might even be divisive.
2. Freedom of Expression:

  * The suspension for finding humor in an SNL sketch from the 1970s, which might be seen as offensive by today's standards, strikes at the heart of freedom of expression. Should we really penalize someone for a comedic taste that aligns with a different era's norms? This action could set a precedent for stifling diverse perspectives, which are crucial for a vibrant, innovative community like ours.
3. Contextual Understanding:

  * The developer's comments on topics like reverse racism or sexism were arguably an attempt to engage in complex discussions. While the approach might not have been perfect, such dialogues are essential for growth and understanding. Punishing these attempts might discourage others from engaging in meaningful discourse, fearing misinterpretation or backlash.
4. Impact on Community Dynamics:

  * Suspending a core developer for discussions that, while controversial, were not malicious, could lead to a chilling effect. Contributors might hesitate to share ideas or critique existing frameworks out of fear of being too "unwoke," potentially leading to less innovation and collaboration.
5. Overemphasis on Conformity:

  * The Python community thrives on diversity of thought. By suspending a developer for not conforming strictly to a particular narrative, we risk turning our community into an echo chamber where only certain views are tolerated. This not only affects morale but also the quality and breadth of our development.

In Conclusion:

The decision to suspend this developer seems disproportionate and potentially counterproductive to the values of inclusivity, openness, and intellectual freedom that Python stands for. We need to foster an environment where discussions, even those that make us uncomfortable, can occur without fear of severe repercussions. It's crucial to differentiate between truly harmful behavior and discussions that might challenge our sensibilities but contribute to our collective growth.

I urge the Steering Council to reconsider these kind of extreme political suspensions, engage in a broader community dialogue about what our CoC should realistically encompass, and ensure that our community remains a bastion of free thought and innovation, not just in coding but in all forms of interaction. Let's strive for a balanced approach where respect and freedom coexist, allowing Python to continue its legacy as a community that values all contributors' voices.
