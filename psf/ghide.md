On the contrary. Do whatever you think is best with it including
posting it publicly verbatim. And please keep my name on it. In my
opinion the problem here is lack of public scrutiny and open debate.

What are they going to do? Ban me from posting somewhere that I
already don't post? Prevent me from answering questions on the
python-help mailing list? Unilaterally revoke my status as a fellow?
I've been kicked out of fancier clubs.

Here is the entire exchange:

Please tell me what rule Guido’s post violated.<br><br>

- **David Lord davidism Aug 28**<br><br>
Multiple people indicated they felt that post was inappropriate through flags and private discussion. The person was suspended in part because of their actions and statements about votes and the to ask about votes and the board is inappropriate. Especially in the midst of plenty of other people being able to speak to the nuances of voting just fine. And especially from the language author who wields a great amount of public attention and trust in anything said by them. Core team members are expected to act as role models for the community, and that post didn't match that expectation.

I asked about a rule.

You seem to be saying that Tim was banned for expressing certain opinions and expressing respect for his knowledge on a related
subject is a satisfactory reason for you to cancel a post. Is that right?

    You can find the guidelines we expect everyone to follow here:
    Guidelines - Discussions on Python.org as well as here: Python
    Software Foundation Code of Conduct - Python Software Foundation
    Policies. We evaluate flags in the context of these guidelines in
    order to come to decisions.

    > Is that right?

    No, your interpretation does not match our understanding of the
    situation. If you’re concerned with moderation decisions beyond
    this, please send a report to the Code of Conduct team: Python
    Software Foundation Code of Conduct - Python Software Foundation
    Policies

Following David Lord's suggestion, I emailed the Code of Conduct
group to ask them to explain the situation since he wouldn't. They
were also unwilling to provide any clarification.
