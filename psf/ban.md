title: Dispelling Information Asymmetry
---

Scope
-----
This is about my (Tim Peters) 3-month [ban](https://discuss.python.org/t/three-month-suspension-for-a-core-developer/60250) from CPython core development, announced 7-Aug-2024. The intent is to eliminate the "information asymmetry" that usually accompanies a ban, by disclosing my interactions with PSF representatives in full. I've always advocated for transparency in all matters. I didn't want an "anonymous" ban to begin with, and want no secrets (aka "privacy") during the ban either. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

Glossary
--------
- PSF: Python Software Foundation. a US 501(c)(3) non-profit membership organization holding the intellectual property rights in the open source Python programming language
- CoC: Code of Conduct
- CoC WG: a PSF working group charged with CoC enforcement
- SC: Steering Council, a PSF group charged with core language development
- CPython: the implementation of Python using the C language, the primary PSF "deliverable"
- CPython core dev: a person working on the CPython distribution granted commit privileges by the SC
- Discourse: a Python-related discussion forum run by the PSF
- mod: a moderator on Discourse, with broad powers over posters and their posts
- DM: a "direct message" on Discourse, sent to an individual rather than posted to the public

I'm "the person in question". No secrets were kept at my
request, or preference. Here's a summary of "secret information"
actions involving me before the ban. Full disclosure. It's exhaustive,
to the best of my recollection and GMail's search abilities. I want
this to be the most transparent ban possible (granting the obvious
need for the CoC WG to preserve privacy for people filing complaints -
but I know nothing about those anyway).

The summary:

**Number of times the CoC WG contacted me: 0**

The announcement never actually says a CoC complaint
was filed against me. If there was, they skipped all the steps on the
CoC enforcement page that involve contacting me. The first time I saw
these charges was the first you saw them: after I was already banned.

**Number of times I contacted the CoC WG: 2**
1. I DM'ed a CoC WG member to tell them I intended never to post in [my
neurodivergence topic](https://discuss.python.org/t/how-can-we-better-support-neurodivergent-newcomers-to-the-community/58724) again,
so would never ask for an official
response, but asked if they would at least consider adding "neurotype"
to the CoC's enumeration of protected classes. They replied that
suggestions should be emailed to the CoC WG. I replied that since they
were in that group, if they thought it was a good idea they would
suggest it themself. So they clearly didn't like the idea, and that
was fine by me, but I was done with the topic regardless. They "liked"
that reply, and that was the end of it.

2. The only time I ever filed a CoC complaint. It was against someone
with power, and not suitable to make public. It wasn't directly about
anything publicly visible on Discourse. It wasn't aimed at anyone on
the SC. It shouldn't be relevant to the ban, but I can't know whether
it was. Only they could answer that. It doesn't appear to have any
relation to any of the charges - but then I don't know what some of
them might be about.

**Number of times a Discourse mod contacted me in their role as a mod: 2**
1. A mod told me they moved a post I made, in the bylaws topic, into a
new topic. I replied that was fine, and agreed it was a good decision.

2. A mod told me a post was offensive. I didn't push back. I acted at once to
address it, and did more than they asked to repair the claimed offense.
***A key to this*** was that their complaint was specific, direct, and
arguably passed a
"[reasonable person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person)" test.

**Number of times I contacted a Discourse mod in their role as a mod: 1**

In the closed PSF topic about David Mertz giving up PSF Fellow status,
I contacted a mod to pass on, from David, that Marc-Andre Lemburg's
correction to David's final post got the details right. A mod edited
the suspension announcement to add that info near the top. I thanked
them, and that was the end of it.

No, I never contacted a mod to ask that one of my (or anyone else's)
hidden posts be unhidden, let alone to argue about it. That's their
call.

I did publicly express disapproval of some moderator actions, but
about others' posts, not my own. That was before the current "Public
posts confronting moderators about their decisions will not be
tolerated." rule was imposed, never after. I would like to (but don't)
believe that my feedback before then played a role in the mods
agreeing to stop rewording posts.

**Number of times the Board contacted me: 0**

**Number of times I contacted the Board: 0**

**Number of times the SC contacted me: 1**

[Emily Morehouse](https://discuss.python.org/t/three-month-suspension-for-a-core-developer/60250/18) is correct that I was dismissive of the SC's message. You'll have to take some things on
trust here, because I don't have (and didn't ask for) permission
to share their email to me. For the same reason, I won't
reproduce my reply to them (which quotes their email).

In the end, their message appeared to me, rightly or wrongly,
to have been made in bad faith. ***A key to this***
is that it was mostly very vague, and the one specific claim it made
didn't pass a "reasonable person" test to me[^1].

[^1]: While they didn't reply, they apparently agreed, since the specific claim they made never appeared in public - they changed the claim before public posting, but to one which also didn't pass a reasonable person test to me - at which point my suspicion of bad faith increased.

Without specificity, the best I could make of it was "we're not
objecting to what you're saying, we're objecting to who you are -
become someone different, in ways you must already know we have in
mind". It left both sides unmoved, but they didn't reply to my reply,
so there was no "discussion". It was a one-time exchange of
monologues. Discussion didn't start until after the ban was announced
(but this post is only about pre-ban).

**Number of times I contacted the SC: 0**

**Number of times a plain user contacted me privately to argue: 0**

**Number of times I contacted a plain user privately to argue: 0**

To be clear: "Plain user" means anyone without relevant power (not on the CoC WG,
Board, SC, or a mod).
"Privately" means not in a Discourse public post, regardless of
whether by Discourse DM, email, social media, in real life ...
"Argue" means to express an opposing opinion, or in any other way
disagree, complain, insult, threaten, etc.

I also contacted Brett Cannon a few times not accounted for above, but not
for his role as a mod or as a CoC WG member, but as "just Brett", a
long-time colleague I've always been on friendly terms with, to chat
and ask his opinion. While I can't know, I strongly doubt that has any
relevance here. He recused himself from the CoC WG's vote.

Besides that, I never contacted anyone else with power, nor they me,
about anything, apart from public Discourse posts. It's possible that
one of the CoC WG members saw posts of mine on Facebook (shared only
to "friends"), but best I recall no pre-ban post there mentioned
anything about PSF spaces. But Facebook search is feeble, and I may
have missed one. I had no account, or ever posted, on other gossipy
sites (no Twitter/X, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Reddit, Hacker News, ...).

So it's hard to believe that anyone filed a complaint about non-public
contacts, because there were none of any relevance that weren't
thoroughly friendly on both sides.

That's all. Two grand total "official" complaints to me, and no non-official
relevant contacts. One official complaint (from a mod) was resolved
almost at once, and the other (from the SC) fell flat.

What actually works
-------------------
If the "***a key to this*** ..." parts sound reminiscent of what replies in
my PSF topic on neurodivergence said about what's needed, I think
that's on target.

I never intend to offend. If I do, I'm happy to be told so, directly, as
specifically as possible, and bluntly. There's no need to make it
"sound nice". I won't take offense, I've cheerfully endured mountains
of public abuse for decades. There's a mild example of that in the
bylaws  topic, where someone bluntly told me I was acting like an ass,
but was very specific about in what way. Their tone was hostile. I
didn't care. I thanked them for pointing it out - and publicly agreed
their specific complaint had merit, and didn't repeat the behavior
again. They did more to change my behavior, with one very brief post,
than all the "official" channels combined. Ponder that.

Conclusion
----------
"My side" is an open book now.

There was close to no pre-ban "secret information" involving me, and
so also almost none that could possibly be relevant to the outcome.
What remains of the messages in the topics involved are all the
evidence you'll ever get. You knew almost everything knowable when the
ban was first announced. Answers are not to be found by appealing to
the "god of the gaps" in this specific ban. Perhaps in other bans, but
not in this one.

Addendum
--------
Of course many people saw this coming. It was hard to miss that _some_ "old timer"
was in the crosshairs. But it wasn't exactly[^2] clear who until I saw
[this post](https://discuss.python.org/t/im-leaving-too/58408/9). Note especially
who "liked" it.

So I knew then "OK! I'm next." The only surprise then was how long it took.

Addendum 2
----------
Here's [some Q&A](ban_qa) from responses to this blog.

[^2]: Two of the SC's complaints in [their public topic](https://discuss.python.org/t/inclusive-communications-expectations-in-python-spaces/57950) were obviously aimed at me, but the referent for "soft conduct moderation" was unknown. As detailed above, I never opposed a mod action against me, so I wasn't a plausible guess. No clarification was made, beyond that they didn't mean David Mertz (who seemed to be most peoples' guess).
